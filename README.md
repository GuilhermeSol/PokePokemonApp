Pokémon iOS App – MVVM & TDD Showcase

This iOS application was developed as a technical demonstration of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, implemented entirely with native Apple frameworks and SwiftUI.
The project emphasizes clean separation of concerns, reactive UI binding, and testability—core principles of MVVM—while showcasing how SwiftUI naturally complements this architectural pattern.

Built with a test-driven development (TDD) approach, the app includes comprehensive unit tests that validate business logic, view models, and service layers. 
The goal was to highlight how TDD can be effectively integrated into the iOS development workflow, ensuring reliability and maintainability from the ground up.

Design and visual polish were intentionally deprioritized to keep the focus on architecture and testing practices. 
The app serves as a learning tool or reference implementation for developers interested in mastering MVVM and TDD in a SwiftUI environment, without the distraction of advanced UI styling or animations.
